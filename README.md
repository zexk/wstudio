# wstudio

A keyboard-centric digital audio workstation written in
[Zig](https://ziglang.org/) (0.16).

## Pitch

Making music without leaving the home row. wstudio borrows the modal
model from vim:

- **normal**: navigate the project, drive the transport (`space`
  play/stop, `hjkl` with counts, `gg`/`G`, ...)
- **insert**: the keyboard becomes a piano, tracker-style layout where
  the z-row is one octave (`z` = C, `s` = C#, `x` = D, ...) and the q-row
  the next; `-`/`=` shift octaves
- **visual**: select clips and ranges
- **command**: ex-style `:` commands

And it ships batteries included: synths, samplers, a drum machine, and a
full effects rack (EQ, compression, reverb, delay) are built in. No
plugin hunting before the first note.

## Status

Early but live, and audible. `wstudio` opens a TUI with a single blank
track; press `enter` to pick an instrument (synth, sampler, or drum
machine) and a per-track FX rack. Vim-style modal control drives it,
with live keyboard playing through ALSA (PipeWire/PulseAudio serve its
`default` device, so any desktop works; a silent wall-clock backend
takes over when no device exists).

- `wstudio`: new, empty session (one blank track)
- `wstudio demo.wsj`: the curated four-track demo (lead, e-piano, bass, drums)
- `wstudio song-demo.wsj`: the same tracks arranged into a 16-bar song; opens
  in song mode, so `space` sweeps the timeline (press `A`, then `T` to compare
  with pattern mode)
- `wstudio render`: the offline pipeline demo rendered to a WAV

Tracks start blank: `enter` on a blank track opens the instrument
picker. Synth and sampler tracks are piano-roll sequenceable (`p`);
drum-machine tracks open the step grid (`enter`), and `e` there opens
the per-pad sampler editor. `A` opens the arrangement view, where clips
stamped from the live patterns are placed on a bar timeline and `T`
toggles between pattern and song playback. `:load-sample <file>` swaps
a sampler's clip; `:load-pad <0-7> <file>` swaps a drum pad.

```

Three rules hold everything together:

1. **The audio thread never blocks.** `Engine.process` is allocation-free
   and lock-free; all mutation arrives via the SPSC command queue.
   Device buffers are allocated up front, never in `process`.
2. **The engine is a library.** Frontends (TUI now, GUI later) import
   `wstudio` and talk to the engine only through its public API.
3. **Input is a pure state machine.** Key to action mapping lives in
   `input/modal.zig` with no UI dependency, so bindings are unit-tested
   and identical across frontends.

## Building

```sh
nix develop          # zig, zls, audio libs
zig build run        # launch the TUI (space = play, i = piano mode, :q = quit)
zig build run -- demo.wsj  # open the curated four-track demo project
zig build run -- render  # offline demo: melody through the chain -> out.wav
zig build test       # all tests
zig build genkit     # re-render the embedded drum kit (after editing drum_kit.zig)
zig build gendemo    # re-write demo.wsj (after editing tools/gendemo.zig)
zig build gensongdemo # re-write song-demo.wsj (arranges demo.wsj into a song)
nix build            # packaged build via zig.hook
```

## Roadmap

- [x] TUI frontend wiring the modal input layer to a real terminal
- [x] Native audio backend (ALSA; PipeWire serves it on modern systems)
- [ ] Native PipeWire and JACK backends behind the same interface
- [x] Song mode: arrangement timeline with per-track clips
- [x] Per-track instrument insertion (synth / sampler / drum machine)
- [ ] Audio clips: WAV clip playback on tracks
- [x] More devices: EQ, sampler, drum machine (filters, chorus to come)
- [x] RT-safe parameter changes (device params over the command queue)
- [x] Project save/load
- [ ] Persist user-loaded sample audio in .wsj
- [ ] Plugin hosting (CLAP first)
